          <h5>Week-01: HTML, CSS</h5>
          <p><strong>What have I learned this week?</strong> Not sure. I've heard about many new things, and saw them, but cannot say I learned them at all. There are a few things though which I definitely know as we are at the end of this week:

        <div class="toplist">
          <ul>
            <li>I have new programs on my computer: Atom, Git</li>
            <li>I started to use English keyboard </li>
            <li>I use now Trello, Slack and Github daily </li>
            <li>I started to use features in several programs which I haven't used before </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <blockquote><p>First week was though.</p></blockquote>

      <div>
        <h5>Week-02:  HTML, CSS</h5>
        <h4>What's new?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Success. And than suddenly feel deeply hopeless. :)</li>
          <li> Form, table </li>
          <li> {float:...}, flexbox </li>
          <li> Animation</li>

      <h4>How does it feel to be a 2 weeks old programmer? </h4>
        <p>
          It feels great. :) <br> Basically my days are all about searching and testing. I've never used Google this actively in my life. I'm looking for solutions all the time, for all those problems and tasks Green Fox is giving us. Then I'm testing those solutions. And repeat.

        <h4>What's new?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Hava, jáva, háva, dzsava...</li>
          <li> Youtube adds. </li>
          <li> I miss HTML and CSS.</li>

      <h4>How does it feel to be a 2 weeks old JAVA programmer? </h4>
        <p>
          I was waiting for learning Java, as it's the main part of our program at Green Fox. It's difficult for the first (and) second sights as well, but getting better day by day. :)

        <blockquote><p>I have no idea. But everyone says its fine and will get better. </p></blockquote>

        <div>
          <h5>Week-05: OOPs - JAVA</h5>
          <h4>What's new/permanent?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> ObjectOrientation.</li>
            <li> Inheritance, abstract classes and methods. And classes. And methods. </li>
            <li> RollerCoaster.</li>
            <li> Google is my great old friend. Debugger is the new. </li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <h4>How does it feel to be a 3 weeks old JAVA programmer? </h4>
          <p>
            Everyone was afraid of object orientation - but it's helped a lot to understand better last two weeks material.
            Working on the project was a great experience.  Building it up individually, thinking through the details and work them out with mentor's help was a great challenge.
